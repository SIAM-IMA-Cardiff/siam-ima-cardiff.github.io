## Welcome to the Cardiff Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) - Institute of Mathematics & its Applications (IMA) Student Chapter!

We organise various academic and social events for postgraduate students in Cardiff, including weekly seminars given by PhD students and a weekly 'PGR tea at 3'.
We also organise various events such as the introductory poster presentation for welcoming new students, and the Three minute thesis competition.
