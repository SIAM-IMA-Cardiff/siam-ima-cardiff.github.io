<p>Title: Sum Systems</p>

<p>Speaker: Ambrose Law</p>

<p>Abstract: Many fields of mathematics are born from simple but potent questions. The study of Sum Systems comes from such; given a natural number n, can you find two sets such that by taking every combinations of sums between elements of the two sets you get each value 0, 1, 2,â€¦, n uniquely? This talk will be an introduction to the field of Sum Systems, some of their inheritance properties, and will discuss how deep the patterns go. This is a Number Theory based talk but can be enjoyed by any area of mathematics.</p>
