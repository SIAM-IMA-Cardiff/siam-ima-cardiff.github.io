Hi, I'm Tasarla and I'm a second year PhD student researching Quantum Field Theory and Operator Algebras in the GAPT research group. My project, funded by EPSRC, focuses on R-matrices (solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation) that satisfy the “contraction relation” derived from the defining relations of the BMW algebra. This has applications in various areas, including quantum computing. I run the Cardiff Women in Mathematics and Computer Science society, am on the EDI (Equality, Diversity and Inclusion) board, and am the Piscopia representative for Cardiff. Please feel free to get in contact with me regarding EDI, outreach, and any problems you’re having!
