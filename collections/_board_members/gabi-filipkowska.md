Hi, I am Gabi, a second year PhD Student in Financial Mathematics. My research is funded by EPSRC and is focused on understanding risks associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and learning the impact of regulatory interventions on them. In my free time, apart from being an eager mushroom picker/identifier, I like to do some embroidery, program games, or go to gym classes.
