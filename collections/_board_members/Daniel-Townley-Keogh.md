Hello, my name is Daniel and I'm a 4th year MMath student at the School of Mathematics at Cardiff University. My main focus currently is my masters project, which is based on Galois Theory and its applications to Classifying Modular Invariants. I'm a fluent Welsh speaker, and as one of the Welsh Communications Officers I hope to contribute to the betterment of Welsh-language inclusion in an academic setting, and also helping to make sure this remains an important part of our future vision. In my spare time I enjoy volunteering as a rugby coach/referee, gaming and playing Magic the Gathering.
