Hi, I’m Lucy and I’m in the 2nd year of my interdisciplinary PhD in Computer Science, Mathematics and Engineering. This research, sponsored by EPSRC, involves using mathematical modelling to optimise the UK’s transition from conventional vehicles to electric vehicles. This work supports the government’s goal of decarbonising the transport sector. I am also part of the Sustainable Transport Interdisciplinary Doctoral Training Hub and the university’s squash club committee.
