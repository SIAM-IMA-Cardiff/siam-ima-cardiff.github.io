I'm a third-year PhD student in the School of Mathematics, where I'm part of the analysis research group. My research focuses on geometric analysis, particularly the stability of various geometric inequalities. I use tools like geometric flows and PDE theory to understand problems in stability. Outside of my academic life, I enjoy spending time outdoors, exploring the beautiful UK landscapes on hikes, and taking walks around the city. In my free time, I like to hang out with friends, hosting game nights, and I have a growing collection of plants that I care for.
