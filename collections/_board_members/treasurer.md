Hi, my name is Harry and I am a 1st year Mathematics PhD student in the Applied and Computational Research group at Cardiff University. My research focuses on the mathematical modeling of biological processes, specifically simulating cell motion through a process known as blebbing. I hope to find a relationship between cell motion and local topographic environments that can be used to improvement medical treatments or slow down the rate of disease spreading within the body. In my free time I enjoy climbing, hiking and playing video games.
