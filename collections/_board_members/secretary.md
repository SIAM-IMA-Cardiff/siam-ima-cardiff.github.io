I am a second year part-time PhD student in COMSC doing research into entertainment value and combinatorial optimisation, specifically looking at how vote reveal orders can be optimised for entertainment (in other words, I watch Eurovision and complain about the votes). I am particularly interested in operational research and multi-objective optimisation. I like to play pool and poker (I'm usually up for a game at PGR game nights and pub trips) and also do bouldering and mountain biking in my free time.
