I am a third year part-time PhD student in COMSC doing research into measuring and maximising entertainment value. I look at voting problems such as Eurovision and aim to maximise entertainment through combinatorial optimisation. I'm currently investigating how scoring rules could be adjusted in competitions such as sports leagues and motorsports to encourage greater competition while reducing the risk of a competitor winning the tournament early. I like playing poker and pool, so you might see me at PGR game nights, or at the pub on a Friday evening!
