Hi, I’m Matt and I’m a first year PhD student in the Statistics group. My project, funded by the EPSRC, is based in kernel methods and mathematical machine learning. I am studying techniques for the sparsification of datasets for use in large-scale machine learning problems and developing novel approximation strategies for such problems. In my free time, I enjoy listening to heavy metal music and I am part of the Cardiff University Medieval Reenactment Society.
