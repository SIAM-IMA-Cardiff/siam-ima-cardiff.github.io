Hi, my name is Michela and I’m a third year PhD student in the Statistics group, funded by EPSRC. My research lies in extreme value theory, a branch of statistics which seeks to assess the probability of extreme events, which are typically rare and can have a big impact on infrastructure and society. In particular, I’m focusing on translating established kernel-based methods to an extremes framework in order to assess extremal dependence in high-dimensional extremes. In my spare time, I’m a keen swimmer and an avid reader.
