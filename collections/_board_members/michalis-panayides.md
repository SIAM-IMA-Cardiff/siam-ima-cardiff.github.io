Hello, my name is Michalis and Iâ€™m in my 3rd year of my PhD, working in the school of Mathematics of Cardiff University. My main research revolves around using Operational Research techniques to investigate the behavioural gaming that takes place in healthcare scenarios. My work is being done in parallel with ethnographic studies and is directly applied to the interaction between the UK's Emergency Departments and Emergency Medical Services.
