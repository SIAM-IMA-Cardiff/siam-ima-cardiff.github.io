Hey! I'm a second year part-time doctoral candidate in the School of Computer Science and Informatics. My research looks at the security of Cyber Physical Systems behind the running of Critical National Infrastructure. I also teach Introduction to Web Development to our first years on our Applied Software Engineering Bachelors degree. When I'm not coding, I'll be reading somewhere surrounded by trees, painting something I find beautiful, or playing guitar & singing. When you're surrounded by technology all day, an escape to the natural world can be refreshing.
