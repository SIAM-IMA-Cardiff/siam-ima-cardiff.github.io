Hello, I'm the webmaster for the years 2023 to 2024 and am currently in the fourth year of my PhD in the School of Computer Science. My research is focused on how successful teams of humans and Deep Neural network-based agents are formed and maintained. This is currently looking at allowing a human to better "trust" the machine, with a focus on explainable AI. When I am not in the office I also volunteer as a Scout leader, bake, and play more pool than I would like to admit.
