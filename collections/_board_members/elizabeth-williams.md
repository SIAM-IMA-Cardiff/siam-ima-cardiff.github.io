Hi, I am Elizabeth, a third year PhD student based in the Operational Research group.  It is a great privilege to be the president of a group of PhD students from a wide range of research interests and multicultural backgrounds. I am funded by the KESS2 scholarship along with Clinical Futures in Aneurin Bevan University Health Board. My research focuses on healthcare modelling and more specifically elderly and frail patient care in South Wales. The work focuses on bed capacities across multiple hospitals to assist in prediction for hospital admission and length of stays.
