Hi, I’m Matthew and I am a 2nd year Mathematics PhD student in the Operational Research group at Cardiff University. My project is jointly funded by the EPSRC and Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, and currently sees me working with the orthopaedics department at the health board. Using simulation and optimisation techniques, the aim of my work is to help improve the department’s elective care services and recover from the pressures induced by the COVID-19 pandemic.
