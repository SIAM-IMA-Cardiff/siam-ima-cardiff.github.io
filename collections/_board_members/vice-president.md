Hi, Iâ€™m Elin and I am a second year PhD student in the School of Mathematics at Cardiff University, and I am a part of the Operational Research group. My research is funded by the Gwent Area Planning Board where the objective of the project is to understand how alcohol drinking behaviours affect healthcare, social care and criminal justice services in Gwent, and to explore demand and capacity planning. I enjoy spending my free time playing the harp or singing. I am also a foodie and enjoy trying new restaurants in Cardiff.
