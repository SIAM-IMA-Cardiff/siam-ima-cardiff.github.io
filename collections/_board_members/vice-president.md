Hi, I’m Rhys, a second-year PhD student in mathematics, in the applied and computational math group. My research focuses on the numerical modeling of granular flows using continuum methods. I aim to develop more efficient and accurate techniques that can help mitigate the damage caused by natural disasters and enhance the efficiency of industrial processes. In my free time, I enjoy playing games—both board games and video games—as well as watching various sports, movies and tv shows.
