Hi, Iâ€™m Matthew and I am a 3rd year Mathematics PhD student in the Operational Research group at Cardiff University. My project is jointly funded by the EPSRC and Cardiff and Vale University Health Board. Currently I'm working on a hybrid simulation model for the T&O department at the health board, that captures the dynamics between population health and patient flow in the department. Doing so seeks to help reduce the pressure the service's elective care pathway is under. In my spare time, I can be found reading, gaming, or listening to Taylor Swift.
