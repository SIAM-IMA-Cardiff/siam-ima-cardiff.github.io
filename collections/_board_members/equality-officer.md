Hi, I’m Alesia and I am a fourth-year Mathematics PhD student in the Statistics and Data Science Research group at Cardiff University. My research project is funded by the Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research. I’m currently working at the interface of optimisation, machine learning and numerical linear algebra, specifically in finding the solutions to large-scale linear systems of equations using iterative methods, and their applications. In my spare time, I enjoy being in nature, especially around animals. I also like playing games, dancing and creating arts & crafts.
