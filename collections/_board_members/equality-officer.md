Hey, Iâ€™m a 1st year PhD student in the School of Mathematics and I am a part of the Statistics research group. My work focuses on stochastic processes, their properties, and applications.
I am also passionate about teaching math. Beyond the academic realm, I volunteer for a charity, read books, love hiking, traveling, and reading toxic tweets.
