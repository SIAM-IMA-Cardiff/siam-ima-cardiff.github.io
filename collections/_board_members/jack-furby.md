Hello, I'm the webmaster for the year 2022 to 2023 and am currently in the third year of my PhD which is in the school of Computer Science. My research is focused on how successful teams of humans and Deep Neural Network based agents are formed and maintained. This is currently looking at allowing a human to better "trust" the machine and allowing the machine to better predict the human, possibly doing this in the domain of Chess. When I am not in the office I also volunteer as a Scout leader, bake, and play more pool than I would like to admit.
