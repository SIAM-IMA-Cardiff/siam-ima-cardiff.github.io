Hi, I'm Tim and I am a 2nd year PhD student in the mathematical biology group. My project, which is funded by the KESS2 scholarship and cofunded by the London Women's Clinic, looks at using time-lapse images of embryos thawing after vitrification to select the healthiest embryos which have the greatest chance of leading to pregnancy. I also investigate the way embryos warm up during cryopresevation, in order to validate handling protocols designed to prevent thermal damage. When I'm not working I'm usually baking, gaming or watching F1.
