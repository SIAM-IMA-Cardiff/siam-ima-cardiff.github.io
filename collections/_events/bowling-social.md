We will be holding a PGR Bowling Night on Tuesday the 30th of May at Superbowl UK Cardiff (by the Principality Stadium)

This is a non-alcoholic event, so whilst we are there, we kindly ask that you do not have any alcohol whilst playing. However, you are more than welcome to go for a drink elsewhere after the event.

Booking will also require a payment of Â£13.50 per person, which covers the cost of two games. Details on how to pay this will follow for those who want to attend.

Hope you can strike a balance between work and play and join us for an evening of fun!
