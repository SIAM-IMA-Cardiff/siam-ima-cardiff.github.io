Bakers!

Are you bready for it?

## When is the event?
Please bring your completed bakes to room 5.05, Abacws at 3pm on Wednesday 22nd February so that we can set up. The event will then start at 3:30pm. We expect the event to last, at most, until 5pm.

## What will it entail?
The aim of the competition is to enter a cake (or other baked good) that visually represents the research topic or findings of your PhD. We kindly ask you to bring along with your bake:

* A list of all ingredients and allergens for your bake.
* The title of your entry.
* A short 150-200 word abstract outlining what your research is.

## Judging criteria and prizes.
For the judging criteria, judges will be taking into account the following:

1. How well does the cake depict the research?
2. How creative is the cake or its presentation?
3. How good does the cake taste?

Once all bakes have been viewed and sampled, judges will then confer and decide on their Star Baker for the competition, as well as a runner-up. For those with their eyes on the pies, the winners will receive the following:

* Star Baker - £25 Love2shop gift voucher
* Runner-up - £20 Love2shop gift voucher

There will also be an audience vote running concurrently, where attendees also get a chance a chance to vote for their favourite bake overall.

* Audience Star Baker - £20 Love2shop gift voucher.
