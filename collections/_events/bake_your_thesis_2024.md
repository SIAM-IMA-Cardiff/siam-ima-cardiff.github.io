It's that time of year again - bakers, we knead you!

After last year's success, we hope you're bready for this year's Bake Your Thesis competition! The aim of the competition is simple - you are tasked with baking something that visually represents the research topic or findings of your PhD.

If you fancy proving yourself an adept baker, or perhaps you're already a legend in the baking, and you are interested in participating in Bake Your Thesis, please reply back to the anoucement email by Friday 9th February. The week thereafter I will send out further details to all who expressed interest.

The event will be on Wednesday 21st February at 3pm in Room 5.05 with the competition open to BOTH Maths and CompSc students. It's all in good fun, so even if you're not a freak in the pastry sheets, just fake it till you bake it! Anyone is also welcome to attend the event and eat some cake!

It will be judged by a panel of judges chosen from both schools, as well as a separate audience vote for their favourite. Prizes will be awarded to the winners!
