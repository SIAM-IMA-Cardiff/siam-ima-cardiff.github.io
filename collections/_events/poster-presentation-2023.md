To welcome new and returning PGR students to the department, we will be hosting a poster presentation on October 4th, featuring work from current students from both Maths and Computer Science. The session will run from 14:00-16:00.

If you wish to submit a poster, please email us with your poster title, and a brief abstract, by 22nd of September.

This is a great opportunity to meet the current students, get a taste for what research life is like and get involved in postgrad life, so we hope to see you there.
