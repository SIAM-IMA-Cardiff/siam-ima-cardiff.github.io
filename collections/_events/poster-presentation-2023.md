We're excited to invite you to our PGR Poster Event session on Wednesday 4th October 2023, which will showcase the high-quality research carried out by PGRs within Mathematics and Computer Science at Cardiff. The event will be held from 2pm-5pm in Abacws Room 5.05.

It will be a fantastic opportunity for you to learn about the research carried out by PGRs here, and will also serve as a nice ice-breaker session for the new starters to meet everyone and settle in.

We hope you'll drop by and show your support!
