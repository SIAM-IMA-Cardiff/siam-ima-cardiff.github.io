On Tuesday 22nd November, we will be hosting a special social at NQ64 on St. Mary's Street. NQ64 is a retro gaming bar on featuring classic arcade games, as well as classic consoles such as the SNES, GameCube, Nintendo 64 and PlayStation. It has a bar that sells gaming themed cocktails, as well as snacks and other drinks! For more info, as well as what games they offer, check out their website here: [https://nq64.co.uk/cardiff/](https://nq64.co.uk/cardiff/)

A group of us will be meeting on the ground floor of Abacws at 5:30pm that day, where we will wait around 5-10 minutes before heading over! Alternatively, if it's easier for you, you can meet us at NQ64 at around 6pm!
