This year, we will be having a meal at ZeroDegrees in the city centre to welcome our new Maths and CompSci PGR students to Cardiff! The meal will be on Wednesday 18th October at 5:30pm. A group of us will be meeting downstairs in Abacws at 5pm on the day, for those who want to walk to the restaurant together.

Please check your emails for a link to pre-order your food. Food has to be ordered by Friday the 13th of October. No payment is needed at the moment, the restaurant will take individual payments on the day.

Looking forward to seeing you there!
