Viscoelastic fluids are a type of Non-Newtonian fluid that deform according to elasticity as well as viscosity. They are ubiquitous in natural and engineering processes so being able to simulate them computationally is of high importance. In my talk I will take particular focus on multiphase flows, where we have two fluids (gaseous and viscoelastic) and define an interface between them. In addition, I will introduce the power of exploiting symmetry to obtain physically 3D results from 2D simulations. Using these broad aspects of computational fluid dynamics I will introduce my mathematical model for simulating these types of flows, with particular focus on rising gas bubble dynamics, where multiple interesting phenomena are presented.
