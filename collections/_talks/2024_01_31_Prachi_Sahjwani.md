In this talk, I will explore the stability of various geometric inequalities. To start, I will define what I mean by geometric inequalities. Then, I will explain the concept of stability in this context and how such a problem is framed mathematically. I will discuss some techniques used to analyse such stability questions and share some of my own results in this area.
