We investigate the properties of a class of piecewise fractional maps arising from the introduction of an invariance under rescaling into convex quadratic maps. The subsequent maps are quasiconvex, and pseudoconvex on specific convex cones; they can be optimised via exact line search along admissible directions and iterates then inherit a bidimensional optimality property. We study the minimisation of such relaxed maps via coordinate descents with gradient-based rules and illustrate that accounting for the optimal rescaling of the iterates can in certain situations substantially accelerate the unconstrained minimisation of convex quadratic maps.
