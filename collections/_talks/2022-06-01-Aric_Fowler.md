In many elections or competitions, a set of voters will either rank a set of candidates from best to worst or will give scores to some of the candidates, with the winner then being the candidate that gets the highest total number of points. When it comes to revealing the result after all votes have been cast, some competitions proceed by having a roll-call of all the voters in which each announces their votes. This is often done for entertainment purposes (e.g., the Eurovision Song Contest), raising the question: Which ordering of voters should be chosen to maximise the entertainment value of the roll-call?
