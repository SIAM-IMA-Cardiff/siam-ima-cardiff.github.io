title: "Dominating sets on vertex weighted graphs"
speaker: Lukas Dijkstra
---
Dominating sets can be used in many applications of graph theory as a means to reach every vertex as efficiently as possible. Usually, we only try to minimize the size of such a set, but if every vertex also has an associated weight, or cost, what methods can we use to optimize a dominating set both in terms of size and weight?
