Medication non-adherence is a global public health concern, especially among older adults. There is an opportunity for the robots to help the older adults with this problem. My PhD research is about exploring the potential for the social robots to help older adults with their medication management in their home settings. For this, I have conducted two studies. First to understand the perspective of older adults and their caregivers about keeping the robots in their home settings. Second to explore if the social robots will be acceptable by the older adults in the other cultural settings e.g., Global South. In this talk, I will provide a succinct overview of these studies and the future of robots in this area.
