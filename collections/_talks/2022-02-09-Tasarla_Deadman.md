title: "From plaiting hair to building a quantum computer: R-matrix representations of deformations of the braid group"
speaker: Tasarla Deadman
---
In this talk I will define the braid group and discuss its relevance to topological quantum computing. I then discuss a deformation of the Braid group called the BMW algebra and represent this using R-matrices (matrices that satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation). I go on to generalise the constant restrictions of this representation to develop a class of matrices dubbed the “contractive R-matrices”. Finally, time-permitting I will briefly delve into properties & examples of these contractive R-matrices.
