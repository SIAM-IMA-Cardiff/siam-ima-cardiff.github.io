Since the release of Bitcoin in 2009, cryptocurrency markets have been quickly evolving with their market capitalisation reaching even $3 trillion U.S. dollars. These markets are seen as volatile, speculative, prone to manipulation and lacking intrinsic value. Therefore, regulators all over the world are trying to protect their investors by regulating or cracking down on cryptocurrencies at various levels of severity. The UKâ€™s FCA ban on crypto derivatives for retail investors is only one example of such restrictions. Excluding a group of traders from the derivatives markets could have altered the information content of the prices. With cryptocurrencies being traded on many markets, it is crucial to know where the information incorporated into prices originates from, and whether it has been affected by the action. As a result, this talk will introduce the concept of price discovery together with the relevant literature. It will demonstrate more and less established methods for analysing it. Finally, it will reveal the leading Bitcoin markets from among four spot and two futures markets.
