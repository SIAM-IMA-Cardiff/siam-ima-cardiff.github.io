Developing biological systems can self-organise to produce complex, diverse and robust patterns of cellular behaviour from relatively simple rules, with examples in animal coat patterns and limb generation during embryo development. In this talk, I will introduce the general concepts of modelling pattern formation in mathematical biology. Then motivated by mammary tissue development, I will discuss how graphs can be used to model pattern formation in systems with distinct cellular identity and polarity (anisotropic cell-cell communication). Using these graphical methods combined with imaging data, we will assess how local tissue geometry influences the amount of polarity required to maintain patterns needed for the healthy development of breast tissue. No knowledge of cellular biology is assumed!
