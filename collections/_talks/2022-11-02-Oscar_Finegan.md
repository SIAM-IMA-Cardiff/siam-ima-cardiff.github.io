Algebraic geometry is the study of geometric objects which can (locally) be described as the zero locus of a collection of polynomials. One can make us of the algebra to determine whether or not two (or more) geometric objects intersect, but the algebra can actually tell us much more, for instance the multiplicity with which the objects intersect. In this talk, I will attempt to give a brief account of my research in this area and the history of intersection multiplicities.
