Quantum computing is a research field which uses the study of quantum theory to do calculations. The motivation for expanding this area of study was first projected by physicist Richard Feynman, who found classical computers were not efficient enough to deal with the calculations he was producing through his own developments of quantum mechanics. My research focuses on the construction of algebras we use to work with particles in the systems which arise from quantum mechanics, with a view to advance topological quantum computing.
In this talk, I will begin by introducing particle physics with the assumption of no prior knowledge, and endeavour to communicate the complex world of quantum physics in the most welcoming manner I can manage.
