Category theory is a powerful tool in mathematics, that can be used to describe many, and sometimes rather different, areas of mathematics in one universal language.
In mathematical physics, there are many ways to relate quantum field theories to particular types of categories. My research focuses on how we can use objects in these categories (called algebras) to solve classification problems in the corresponding field theories. In this talk, I will explain the general approach to this problem, and talk through how this can be solved using network graphs in some simple cases.
