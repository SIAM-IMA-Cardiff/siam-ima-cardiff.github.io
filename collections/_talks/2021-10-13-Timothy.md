Title: Differential Dynamic Microscopy- When all you have is a hammer, not every problem is (necessarily) a nail

Speaker: Timothy Ostler

Abstract: Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) is a recent advance on previous Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) techniques designed to extract statistical motility parameters from objects suspended in fluids. DDM is emerging at the forefront of statistical image analysis for a variety of problems, characterising Brownian motion, bacterial motility and Spermatozoa movement with high accuracy, and is robust to a many of the issues that arise in image processing such as noise and problematic parameter initialisation.
 However, DDM is limited in its scope by its reliance on key assumptions about system dynamics being ergodic and isotropic. These assumptions are, in practice, frequently violated, occasionally without the user being aware of such deviation from the assumed underlying behaviour. In this talk, I will give a very gentle introduction to the mathematics behind DDM, and discuss a few cases I have encountered in which DDM requires some adaption or additional consideration before it can be applied. This talk aims to be accessible to both mathematician and computer scientist.
