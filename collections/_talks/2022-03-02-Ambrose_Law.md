My thesis stems from a simple question: given the set {0,1,2,...,N-1}, can you find two other sets, A and B, such that you have A+B={0,1,2,...,N-1} so that each term occurs only once each? Indeed, you can! (If you couldn't, my thesis would be fairly short for sure) A few natural questions might be; can you find 3 sets that sum to make this set? Can you find 10 sets? What connects these sets? Can you do subtraction? All shall be revealed in this talk!
