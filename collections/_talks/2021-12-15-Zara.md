Do YOU think that democracy and free thought is being torn to pieces by the rise of extremism on the internet? Then this talk is for you!

We will look at what political bias is and whether it's inherently bad, as well as how modern NLP techniques can help us to determine political bias in news content, and how we can put this bias rating into context to provide readers with methods to evaluate and contextualise their information.

We will also take a look at how to make machine learning models like this useable by the general public, using Flask APIs and React.
