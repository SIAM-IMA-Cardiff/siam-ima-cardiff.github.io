In this oral presentation Matthew Moloughney will offer insights into current literature about Automated Assessment Tools (AATs) where student feedback has been captured. To inform this discussion, he will make use of an adaptation of the JISC (2015) assessment and feedback lifecycle which may be useful to describe a workflow for formative assessments in teaching practice. This workflow allows for consideration of automated assessment processes well reported and not so well reported in the current literature where teaching-staff and students are considered equal stakeholders. He will demonstrate an AAT for novice programmers resulting from his research, and student feedback.
