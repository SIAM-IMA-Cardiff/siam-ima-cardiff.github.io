Smart devices are becoming increasingly common in both domestic and industrial applications. Some users may choose to use a smart device management tool to automate the operations of multiple devices more conveniently. Smart devices and the services used to control them have varying levels of security which may make them and the network they are connected to. 

For my final year project last year, I proposed and developed a tool that could be used to automatically test the vulnerability of smart devices when interacting with them through a smart device management tool. This tool can be used by both consumers and manufacturers to inform future decisions surround smart device security.
