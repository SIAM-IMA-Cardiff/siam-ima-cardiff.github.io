Title: Sam's Soliloquy about Spheres, Stellations, Centres, Cells, Sides, and SVertices: A Self-Indulgent Deep Dive into Polytopes and Tessellations

Speaker: Sam Richardson

Abstract: As the year draws to a close, join me as I rant about my favourite shapes. From the many centres of the humble triangle to the interesting world of Archimedean polychora!
This talk will attempt to cover a multitude of topics focussed on regular polygons (of which there are â„š+ many!) and the regular (to some degree) structure one can induce in higher dimensions from them.
I will be discussing the 75 uniform polyhedra (plus the infinite families thereof) and the 59 stellations of the icosahedron, two families with only two points of intersection that nonetheless give me an excellent segue into the fourth dimension!
Spheres and Euclidean planes are one thing, but we will also attempt to toe the waters into tessellations of the hyperbolic two and three dimensional planes with a particular focus on some families and their relation to Archimedean solids and tillings.
