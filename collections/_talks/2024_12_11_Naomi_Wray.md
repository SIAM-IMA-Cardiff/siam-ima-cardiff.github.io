The late twentieth century saw huge developments for our understanding of solid-state physics and the interesting behaviour of materials in extreme conditions at the atomic level. This was where electrodynamics paired with the discoveries in quantum physics to unlock some new, emergent particles with bizarre properties. I’ll be introducing and giving a colloquial overview of the Hall effect – a purely electrodynamical experiment in the 1800s – all the way to 1998’s Nobel prize winning discovery of a quantum liquid with excitations of fractional charge. It is these emergent particles with fractional statistics that I model using techniques in Algebraic Quantum Field Theory.
