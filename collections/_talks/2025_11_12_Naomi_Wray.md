 Naomi will present and discuss the exciting work by three scientists who were recently awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics "for macroscopic quantum mechanical tunnelling and energy quantisation in an electric circuit". This is a fascinating discovery in quantum physics which is paving the way for realisations in quantum computing. First Naomi will introduce the beast of quantum mechanics and its many quirks, before seeing some real consequences of these theories. Then, there will be a cascade of Nobel Prize winners and their work contributing to this vast 20th century progress which will eventually pool at the Berkeley Group whose experiments in 1985 are commended in 2025.
For those who haven't seen quantum mechanics before, we'll be thinking of it intuitively where an electron is a ball and a barrier is a wall, except the electrons aren't balls, we don't know where they are, and they can pass through walls.
