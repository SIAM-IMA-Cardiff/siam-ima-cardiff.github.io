Why do traditional ways of visualising information limit how we view and interact with data? Physical forms of data visualisation have promised new ways of interacting with data. However, identifying the needs and preferences of each user to design a personalised data physicalisation is challenging. Further research is required to investigate ways of personalising the content and the data physicalisation's design while providing understandable information in an aesthetically pleasing and artistic way. We propose designing the data sculptures for adaptive configurations and adaptive utility that resonates with people more than generalised displays.
