In this talk, the speaker will share insights from their PhD thesis “Deaf Play: A narrative thesis of Social play contexts of DHH players” which investigates the effects of audio accessibility upon the communication, collaboration and enjoyment of d/Deaf and hard or hearing people when playing video games. This research explores issues experienced by those who are Deaf when trying to play the modern video game experience. It will also delve into their current study, in which they are investigating how those who use a sign language communicate effectively within a cough coop gaming experience and what effect this has on their experience.

This talk will also contain the speaker’s experiences of the PhD process within the Human-Computer Interaction group; challenges, critiques, and learning moments. (hot takes inbound)
