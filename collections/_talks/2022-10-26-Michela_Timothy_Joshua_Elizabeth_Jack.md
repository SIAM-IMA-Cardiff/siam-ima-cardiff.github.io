Starting your PhD is an exciting time, filled with new experiences and opportunities, but casting yourself into the great unknown of postgraduate study can be daunting! Fortunately, you don’t have to do it alone; this talk, given by a group of PhD students in the later stages of their programmes, will share some of the knowledge and experience we have gained over the years, telling you the things we wish we knew when we were just starting. We will cover a wide range of topics, including admin, networking and conferences, important software and looking after your mental health.

This talk is open to students from both Maths and Computer Science, and we encourage the participation of students from all stages of study. This session will be informal, so we welcome discussion within the audience to ensure no question goes unanswered (except ‘When are you submitting your thesis?’).
