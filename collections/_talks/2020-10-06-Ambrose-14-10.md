Our PGR talk series will be kicked off by Ambrose Law, who will be speaking about topics related to his research. The talk will be held at 2pm, and will be followed by PGR Tea at 3. Please come along to support Ambrose, and to hear more about his fascinating work! If you would like to attend, please contact [Elizabeth Williams](WilliamsEM20@cardiff.ac.uk) to get the Zoom link.

Abstract: Many fields of mathematics are born from simple but potent questions. The study of Sum Systems comes from such; given a natural number n, can you find two sets such that by taking every combinations of sums between elements of the two sets you get each value 0, 1, 2,..., n uniquely? This talk will be an introduction to the field of Sum Systems, some of their inheritance properties, and will discuss how deep the patterns go. This is a Number Theory based talk but can be enjoyed by any area of mathematics.
