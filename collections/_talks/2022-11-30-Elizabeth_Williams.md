Ageing is one of the most common and well-known risk factors for most chronic diseases, putting an increasing pressure on healthcare resources. We have utilised a variety of predictive modelling techniques, including classification and regression trees, to determine homogeneous clusters of patient attributes. By incorporating the associated length of stay distributions into deterministic and two-stage stochastic models, we provide novel insights for capacity planning of hospital beds and staffing requirements. This talk will discuss a case study of frail and elderly patients attending hospitals within South East Wales. This approach highlights how applying two healthcare analytical paradigms can be useful for decision makers to capture the stochastic nature of healthcare and make more robust strategic planning decisions.
