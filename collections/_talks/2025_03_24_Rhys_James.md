Modelling granular flows is challenging, primarily because there is no widely accepted unified rheology that spans all flow regimes. Unlike fluids, where relationships like the Navier-Stokes equations or their derivatives, such as Stokes flow, can describe fluid motion, no such relationship exists for granular materials. Instead, the behaviour of granular flows is considered based on their regime, for example: gas-like, fluid-like, or solid-like. My research focuses on these flow regimes and the development and application of numerical methods to effectively model granular flows, with a particular emphasis on meshless continuum methods like smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). In this talk, I will briefly discuss the fundamentals of granular flow rheology, particularly the Î¼(I)-rheology, and the derivation of smoothed particle hydrodynamic approximations.
