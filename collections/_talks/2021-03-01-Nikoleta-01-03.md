Abstract: Evolutionary game theory  (EGT) combines principles of game theory, evolution, and dynamical systems to interpret the interactions of biological agents. There are several basic components to EGT. Game  agents and their strategies, the fitness of different strategies relative to the population, and a process that governs evolution.
In this talk I will give an introduction to EGT and present how it can be used to study the evolution of human cooperation.
