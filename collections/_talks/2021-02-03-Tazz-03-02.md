Title: Sam's Soliloquy about Spheres, Stellations, Centres, Cells, Sides, and SVertices: A Self-Indulgent Deep Dive into Polytopes and Tessellations

Speaker: Tasarla Deadman

Abstract:We begin with the braid group, explaining its motivations in picture form, looking at its more rigorous definition, and seeing its applications in both mathematics and quantum computing. We then discuss the Yang-Baxter equation, tensor products, and R-matrices. We then draw similarities between these R-matrices and the generators of the braid group, and use this to build a representation of braid group. If there’s time, we’ll discuss the BMW algebra, which is an extension of the braid group, and I’ll give a glimpse of my work in constructing an R-matrix representation of the algebra.
