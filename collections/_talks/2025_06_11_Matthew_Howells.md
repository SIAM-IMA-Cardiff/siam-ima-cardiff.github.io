When Taylor Swift released her seventh studio album, *Lover*, she introduced us to a Tennessee girl’s journey to London to see her beloved in the song *London Boy*. The lyrics mention several locations across the city - but visiting them in the order they are sung in the song makes for quite an impractical journey and hardly *The Best Day*. What if we wanted to make this trip as efficient as possible? Fortunately, we can use operational research to help us solve this.
This talk introduces the *Travelling Salesman Problem* (TSP), a classic routing problem in operational research, and how it can be solved to find the shortest path around a set of destinations. By doing so, we can solve the Tennessee girl's London *Love Story* to optimality within Python. 
Along the way, I will look at broader applications of the TSP, and how this kind of problem can benefit academics, industry professionals, and maybe even the world’s most famous popstar.
