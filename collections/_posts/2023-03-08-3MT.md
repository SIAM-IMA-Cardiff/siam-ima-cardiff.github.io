On the 8th of March, the Annual 3MT took place within the School of Mathematics. This competition provided the opportunity for PhD students to present a glimpse of their work to undergraduates, postgraduates and members of staff within the school, all within the time restraint of just 3 minutes.
There were five judges from a variety of mathematical backgrounds - [Dr Thomas Woolley](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/783107-woolley-thomas), [Dr Kirstin Strokorb](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/542989-Dr-Kirstin-Strokorb), [Dr Ulrich Pennig](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/250949-pennig-ulrich), [Dr Nneka Umeorah](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/2606153-umeorah-nneka) and [Timothy Ostler](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/1710088-ostler-timothy).
