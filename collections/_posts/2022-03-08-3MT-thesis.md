---

This year the Cardiff SIAM-IMA chapter is running a 3 Minute Thesis (3MT) competition, where Maths PhD students have the opportunity to present their research in the format of a three minute talk. This is a great chance for the students to hone their presenting skills, and also for attendees to learn about the kind of research that goes on in Cardiff School of Mathematics.The event will take place in Abacws 0.01 at 3:15pm on Wednesday 9th March, and there will be prizes for the winners of the competition as decided by our judging panel and an audience vote.We hope to see as many of you there as possible!
