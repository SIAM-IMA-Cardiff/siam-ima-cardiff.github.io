On the 13th and 14th of June, Cardiff School of Maths helf the SIAM UKIE National Student Chapter Conference 2024.

The event was organised by the SIAM-IMA Student Chapter, together with Dr. Elizabeth Williams and Prof. Angela Mihai. We were grateful to receive funding from both SIAM, and the Cardiff University Doctoral Academy, from which we were successfully awarded their Research Culture and Community Fund.

The conference was well attended, bringing together PhD students from multiple Schools at Cardiff University, as well as other institutions across the UK and Ireland. In all, delegates had the opportunity to attend four plenary talks, 13 contributed talks and a poster session, as well as countless opportunities to network and forge relationships.

The four plenary talks covered a wide range of mathematical areas and were given by:

- Professor Igor Podlubny, from the Technical University of Košice, who presented a talk on fractional calculus;
- Professor Claudia Garetto, from Queen Mary University of London, who gave a talk about higher order hyperbolic equations with multiplicities;
- Doctor Isaac Chenchiah, from the University of Bristol, gave a presentation about morphing triangular frameworks;
- Doctor Matthew Jones, from Nationwide Building Society, who gave a talk about the applications of Artificial Intelligence in financial services.

The contributed sessions covered a wide range of mathematical topics, including analysis, applied mathematics, statistics, operational research and financial mathematics.

The poster session provided attendees with a great occasion to network and discuss research. The audience had the opportunity to rank the posters, and two prizes were awarded:

- The Best Poster Award was presented to Mary Eby from Heriot-Watt University with her poster "Modelling ocean wave-induced microplastic transport in the presence of the Basset-Boussinesq history force";
- The Runner-up Poster Prize was awarded to Rabin Poudel from Cardiff University with his poster "Numerical modelling of stretch-induced instabilities in liquid crystal elastomers".

The conference was a great success and we received very positive feedback from the participants. We'd like to thank all those who participated in the event, whether attending, presenting, or part of the organisational team, in helping make the conference as successful as it was.
