On the 9th of March, the Annual 3MT took place within the School of Mathematics. This competition provided the opportunity for PhD students to present a glimpse of their work to undergraduates, postgraduates and members of staff within the school, all within the time restraint of just 3 minutes.

There were five judges from a variety of mathematical backgrounds - [Professor Maggie Chen](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/138450-chen-maggie), [Dr Thomas Barker](Thomas Barker), [Dr Kirstin Strokorb](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/542989-Dr-Kirstin-Strokorb), [Dr Ana Ros Camacho](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/1750771-ros-camacho-ana) and [Tasarla Deadman](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/1747948-deadman-tasarla).

Talks were given by the following PhD Students:

* Solving PDEs using Proper Generalized Decomposition - [Layla Sadeghi Namaghi](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/1744394-namaghi-layla-sadeghi)
* Modelling the Reconfiguration of Acute and Community Health Services - [Matthew Howells](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/2575967-Matthew-Howells)
* Inside the Bitcoin system - [Gabriela Filipkowska](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/2575982-Gabriela-Filipkowska)

* Super Data Maker - [Thomas Poudevigne-Durance](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/1710096-poudevigne-durance-thomas)
* Knot another 3MT - [Shauna Ford](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/1710064-ford-shauna)
* Mammary Maintenance: Robust Polarity Patterning Mechanisms - [Joshua Moore](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/1710080-moore-joshua)

The quality of the presentations were outstanding, and the judges found it extremely difficult to pick two winners!

The winners of 3MT won a Cardiff indie collection voucher as well as a copy of '50 Visions of Mathematics' book. The winners were:
* 1st Place - [Tim Ostler](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/1710088-ostler-timothy)
* 2nd Place - [Shauna Ford](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/1710064-ford-shauna)
* Audience Favourite - [Gabriela Filipkowska](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/2575982-Gabriela-Filipkowska)
