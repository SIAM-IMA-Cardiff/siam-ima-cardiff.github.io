On the 13th of March, we held our first 3MT for the School of Computer Science. This competition provided the opportunity for PhD students to present a glimpse of their work confined to a very short time and a single slide. Invited to watch were undergraduates, postgraduates and members of staff within the school.

There were four judges from a variety of backgrounds - [Dr Kirill Sidorov](https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/sidorovk), [Dr Louise Knight](https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/knightl2), [Dr Victor Gutierrez Basulto](https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/gutierrezbasultov), and [Dr Sylwia Polberg-Riener](https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/polbergs).

Talks were given by the following PhD Students:

* Did you hear that? Audio Accessibility within Video Games - [Maximillian Curtis-Hedgesâ€‹](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/curtis-hedges,-maximillian)
* Multi-sensor people Counting For Remote Sanitary Facility Monitoring - [Dom Fonseca](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/2500903-fonseca-dominic)
* Machine Learning Threat Detection For Resource Constrained Devices - [Vasilis Ieropoulos](https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/research-staff/ieropoulosv)
* The Score Reveal Problem - [Aric Fowler](https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/fowleraa)

During the competition, each participant presented their talk, followed by the judges leaving the room to discuss their winner and the audience to vote on their favourite. Each talk was judged against the following criteria; content, clarity and charisma.

Although the results were close, two winners were selected:
* Judges choice - Aric Fowler
* Audience Favourite - Dom Fonseca
