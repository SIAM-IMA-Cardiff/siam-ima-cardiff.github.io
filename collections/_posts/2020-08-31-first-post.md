title: "Cardiff PGR welcome poster competition"
---
To welcome new and returning PGR students to the department, we will be hosting a *virtual* poster presentation on October 7th, featuring work from current students. Students can vote on their favourite poster, with prizes for the top three posters! The session will run from 11:00-12:15, and will be followed by virtual tea.

If you wish to submit a poster, please email us with your poster title, and a brief abstract, by 28th September.


This is a great opportunity to meet the current students, get a taste for what research life is like and get involved in postgrad life, so we hope to see you there.
