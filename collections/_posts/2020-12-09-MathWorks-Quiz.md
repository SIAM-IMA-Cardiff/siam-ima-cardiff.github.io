title: "Joint SIAM-IMA chapters event: MathWorks Talk + Quiz, 09/12"
---

The SIAM-IMA student chapters at Strathclyde, Manchester, Cardiff and Dublin have joined forces to organize a joint event.

We will be hosting a social event consisting of a careers talk given by Ben Tordoff and Oli Tissot of MathWorks. The event will take place on Zoom on Wednesday 9th December @ 4pm

MathWorks is primarily known as the developer of MATLAB, amongst other products. Ben has been with MathWorks for 15 years, and currently manages a team developing parallel computing products. Oli joined MathWorks as a software engineer in 2019, having previously completed a PhD in numerical linear algebra. Ben and Oli will tell us a bit about what MathWorks does, and in particular the parallel computing team based in Cambridge, and what it's like to work there!

The talk will be followed by a social event - a team table quiz! We plan to run a table quiz after the talk to give our members a chance to meet and socialize in an informal setting - given everything that is going on the moment we need it!

There will be prizes for the winners and second place: £80 for first place team and £40 for second place team.

Event Timing: Wednesday December 9th  Talk @ 16:00 - 16:45
Quiz @ 17:00 - 17:45
