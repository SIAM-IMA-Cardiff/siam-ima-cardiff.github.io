On the 12th of March, we held our traditional 3MT competition within the School of Mathematics. This competition provided the opportunity for PhD students to present a glimpse of their work to undergraduates, postgraduates and members of staff within the school, all within the time restraint of just 3 minutes using one static slide.
There were four judges from a variety of mathematical backgrounds - [Dr Kirstin Strokorb](https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/strokorbk), [Dr Nneka Umeorah](https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/umeorahn), [Prof Rhyd Lewis](https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/lewisr9), and [Prof Tim Phillips](https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/phillipstn).
Talks were given by the following PhD Students:

* Sufficient Dimension Reduction, A Brief Overview - [Erin-Jana Hoare](https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/research-staff/hoarea)
* Mathematical Modelling of Alcohol Consumption and its Consequences - [Elin Williams](https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/williamseh6)
* Fractal Activity Time Risky Asset Models with Dependence and Heavy-Tailed Distributions - [Bader Saidan](https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/saidanb)
* Solving Large Linear Systems - [Alesia Zverovich](https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/zverovicha)
* A Fractured System: Clinical Pathway Modelling of a Trauma & Orthopaedics Department - [Matthew Howells](https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/howellsma)
* Continuum Modelling of Granular Flows - [Rhys James](https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/jamesr41)
* Network Theory in Modelling Financial Risk Contagion - [Fan Wu](https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/wuf16)

It really was a close fought competition and everyone did very well, so kudos to all who took part, you helped make the event a success! A massive thank you as well to the judges for their time and effort in judging the event, and to the audience for their support and engagement. 
The winners were:

* Judges' Favourite - Rhys James
* Audience Favourite - Matthew Howells
* Audience Runner-Ups - Elin Williams and Alesia Zverovich
