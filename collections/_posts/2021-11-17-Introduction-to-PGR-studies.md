title: "Introduction to PGR studies"
---

This year we’ll be running our Introduction to PGR Studies event, which is a panel session designed to give you an honest idea of what it’s like to be a PhD student. It’ll take place at 14:00 on Wednesday 1st December in Lecture Theatre 0.01 in Abacws and will probably last around an hour. The event will be very informal and will mostly take the form of a free-form Q&A session, where the audience can ask questions about what it is we do all day. These are the topics that we will discuss through the session:

* Internal applications 
* External applications
* Social life, conferences, and public engagement
* What it’s like to research
* Teaching 
* Funding + Industrial Partners

There will also be some light refreshments provided!
