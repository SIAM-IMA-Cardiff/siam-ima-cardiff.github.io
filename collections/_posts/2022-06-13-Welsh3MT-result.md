The Welsh Mathematics 3MT Competition was held at the Welsh Mathematics Colloquium at Gregynog Hall on the 22nd May 2022. This event brought together Mathematics PhD students from across Wales with the chance to present their work in just three minutes. The event was attended by fellow PhD students and academic staff from four universities: Aberystwyth University, Cardiff University, Swansea University and the University of South Wales.

There were four judges from a variety of mathematical backgrounds, one from each University - [Dr Dwion Evans](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/maths/staff-profiles/listing/profile/dfe/), [Dr Matthew Lettington](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/140706-lettington-matthew), [Professor Jiang-Lun Wu](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/cy/staff/j.l.wu/) and [Dr Philip Trevelyan](https://maths.research.southwales.ac.uk/staff-students/philip-trevelyan/).

Talks were given by the following PhD Students:

* Generalised Stirling Operators, with Applications - Chadaphorn Punkumkerd (Swansea University)

* Inside the Bitcoin system - [Gabriela Filipkowska (Cardiff University)](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/2575982-Gabriela-Filipkowska)

* Knot another 3MT - [Shauna Ford (Cardiff University)](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/1710064-ford-shauna)

* Prediction of the capillary pressure and interface shapes in geometrically complex porous media - [Afshin Daverpanah (Aberystwyth University)](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/maths/staff-profiles/listing/profile/afd6/)

* Sum Systems - [Ambrose Law (Cardiff University)](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/1710067-law-ambrose)

* Viscoelastic Multiphase Flow - [Will Doherty (Cardiff University)](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/2442476-doherty-william)

The quality of the presentations were excellent, and provided an opportunity at the beginning of the conference to find out about research areas of fellow PhD Students. There was a judges winner alongside the audience favourite award:
* Judges Winner - [Shauna Ford](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/1710064-ford-shauna)
* Audience Favourite - [Gabriela Filipkowska](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/2575982-Gabriela-Filipkowska)
