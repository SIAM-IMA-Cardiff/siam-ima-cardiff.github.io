Hi everyone!

We have our first Women in Mathematics (WiM) event of the academic  year planned – a talk by our own wonderful Maggie Chen on Tuesday October 27th 1-2pm. She will speak about her research, as well as her experiences as a female mathematics researcher.

This event is **open for everyone to attend** and I hope to see lots of you there!



This will be the first of a new seminar series WiM has set up in collaboration with the Piscopia Initiative called PiWORKS – Piscopia Women and Other Researchers Keynote Seminars. It will be a monthly seminar highlighting female and non-binary researchers in mathematics, with the research discussed aimed to be accessible for undergrads.
