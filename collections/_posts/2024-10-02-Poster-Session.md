On the 2nd October 2024, we ran our PGR Poster Session for the School of Mathematics and School of Computer Science. The event showcased the rich and diverse postgraduate research happening in Abacws, and served as a nice ice-breaker for the new cohort of PGRs starting in October. In total, we were proud to showcase eight posters; five from Maths and three from Computer Science. 

Posters from Maths were presented by Matthew Howells, Ghada Jameel, Anastasiia Kovtun, Charlie Marshall and Fan Wu.

Posters from Computer Science were presented by Max Curtis-Hedges, Jenny Highfield, and James Lewis-Cheetham.

We’re very grateful to the presenters for taking some time out to present at the event. We’d like to thank all staff and students in the School who popped by and showed an interest in PhD research. We hope the event was worthwhile to all!
