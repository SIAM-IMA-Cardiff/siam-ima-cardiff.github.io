***Title: The interplay of geometry and polarity: graphical approaches to signal stability in
bilayer cellular systems.***

Abstract: Over the past two decades, fine-grain patterns produced by juxtacrine signalling have been
studied using static monolayers as cellular domains, where analytical results are limited to a
few cells due to the algebraic complexity of the required nonlinear dynamical systems.  
Motivated by concentric patterning of Notch expression observed in the mammary gland, we
combine concepts from graph and control theory to represent cellular connectivity as a
transitional flow network. The resulting theoretical framework allows us to exploit the
symmetry of multicellular bilayer structures in 2D and 3D, thereby deriving analytical
conditions that drive the dynamical system to form laminar patterns consistent with the
formulation of cell polarity. Applying the analytic conditions to mammary organoids suggests
that intense cell signalling polarity is required for the maintenance of stratified cell-types
within a static bilayer using a lateral-inhibition mechanism. Furthermore, by employing 2D
and 3D cell-based models, we highlight that the cellular polarity conditions derived from
static domains have the capacity to generate laminar patterning in dynamic environments.  
However, they are insufficient for the maintenance of patterning when subjected to
substantial morphological perturbations.

***Title: On Combinatorial Number Theory: Sum Systems And Their Structure***

Abstract: The study of Sum Systems stem from a simple yet potent question; is it possible to find two
sets of positive integers such that by taking the sum of each number in one set with each
number in the other you generate the values 0,1,2,...,N for N any integer? The collection of
these sets is called a Sum System and their structures are of combinatorial number
theoretical interest.

***Title: Deriving Word Vectors from Contextualized Language Models using Topic-Aware
Mention Selection***

Abstract: One of the long-standing challenges in lexical semantics consists in learning representations
of words which reflect their semantic properties. The remarkable success of word
embeddings for this purpose suggests that high-quality representations can be obtained by
summarizing the sentence contexts of word mentions. In this paper, we propose a method
for learning word representations that follows this basic strategy, but differs from standard
word embeddings in two important ways. First, we take advantage of contextualized
language models (CLMs) rather than bags of word vectors to encode contexts. Second,
rather than learning a word vector directly, we use a topic model to partition the contexts in
which words appear, and then learn different topic-specific vectors for each word. Finally, we
use a task-specific supervision signal to make a soft selection of the resulting vectors. We
show that this simple strategy leads to high-quality word vectors, which are more predictive
of semantic properties than word embeddings and existing CLM-based strategies.

quantum computing.

***Title: Interactive AI Technologies for Perceived-Value-driven Behaviour-Based Energy
Management in Buildings***

Abstract: The aim of Pervasive computing is to create ambience in which oneâ€™s experiences and
quality of life are improved by monitoring and assisting people using ubiquitous technologies
and computation in coherence. The atmospheres need computational techniques that can
deal with the evolution and uncertainty of ubiquitous computing environments animatedly
and automatically. We work to provide adaptive thermal comfort models developed through
many studies which suggested that the dynamic thermal based behaviour of occupants can
be utilized to optimize various energy influencing processes in the building.

***Title: Optimising the Transition to Electric Vehicles: The UK Problem***

Abstract: As decarbonisation is becoming increasingly important, many countries have placed an
emphasis on decarbonising their transportation sector through electrification to support the
transition to net zero. As such, many countries are transitioning from conventional vehicles
to electric vehicles in their transportation sector. Mathematical modelling plays an important
role in optimising a transition to electric vehicles, which is the focus of this project.

***Title: The Ambulance Decision Game***

Abstract: Operational Research (OR) techniques provide a toolkit of mathematical modelling
approaches that are routinely used for problem solving in many sectors. Recent research
shows that behavioural studies may accompany such techniques and offer some additional
insight to the problem studied and thus enrich some of the already existing traditional
methods.
Ethnography is considered to be one of the main such approaches. Ethnographic studies
have been around since the 19th century and their main guiding methodology is that a
researcher that aims to study a specific social setting should acquire a deeper understanding
of the cultural norms and values. The main technique that accompanies ethnography is
participant observation, where the researcher participates in the social setting they wish to
study recording their observations.
The application of these ideas and principles considered here is the emergent behaviour that
takes place at the interface between Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and the
Emergency Department (ED). Numerous decisions are taken by both patients and staff alike
that determine the level of workflow and the patient pathway. There is empirical evidence to
suggest that imposing targets in the ED results in gaming at the interface of care between
the EMS and ED. In this work, multiple scenarios are examined where an ambulance service
needs to distribute patients between neighbouring hospitals. The interaction between the
hospitals and the ambulance service is modelled in a game theoretic framework, supported
by a novel Markov model, where the ambulance service has to decide how many patients to
distribute to each hospital.
This work brings together ethnography and game theory to understand the emergent
behaviour in healthcare settings. The talk will present the problem being tackled at the
interface of the EMS and the ED that is to be further informed by ethnographic methods.
