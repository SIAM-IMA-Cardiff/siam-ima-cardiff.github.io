On Wednesday 4th of December, we ran our yearly PGR panel in Abacws with a panel of PhD students from Cardiff University. The event is designed for undergraduate and Master's students to have an insight into what a PhD is like, and how and where they can look to apply to one. The event was attended by students from both the schools of mathematics and computer science, and talks were given on the following topics:

* Internal applications - Naomi Wray
* External applications - James Lewis-Cheetham
* Social life, conferences, and public engagement - Xueyi Wong
* What itâ€™s like to research - Max Curtis-Hedges
* Teaching - Jenny Highfield
* Funding + Industrial Partners - Rhys James

The panel was followed by a Q&A session
