<h2>Welcome to the Cardiff SIAM-IMA Student Chapter!</h2>

<p>The Cardiff University SIAM-IMA Student Chapter is formed by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) and the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) and includes students and faculty members from across Cardiff University who are interested in mathematics or scientific computing and their real-world applications.</p>
	
<p>We organise various academic and social events, including including a weekly PGR seminar and 'PGR Tea', social gatherings and networking opportunities, poster sessions and competitions. Some of our bigger, annual/biannual events include our 3-Minute Thesis competition, Bake Your Thesis, and PGR Panel session for undergraduate and PGT students.</p>

<p>We encourage all students studying a mathematically focused degree to sign-up for membership of SIAM and the IMA:</p>
