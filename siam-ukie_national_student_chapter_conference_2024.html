	<h2>About </h2>
	<p>The Cardiff SIAM-IMA Student Chapter is proud to host the SIAM UKIE National Student Chapter Conference in 2024. The conference is a two-day event on Thursday 13th and Friday 14th of June. </p>
	<p>The two-day conference will include four invited talks, contributed talks by attendees, a poster session and a conference dinner. Invited speakers cover various mathematical backgrounds, and we are pleased to also have an industry speaker at the conference. The conference is open to all postgraduate research students across the UK and Ireland. There will be plenty of opportunities to network. Moreover, this offers a great chance to those attending to present their research, either through a poster or a contributed talk.</p>
	<p>The conference will be held in the newly built Abacws building, located in Cardiff. We are a 30 minute walk from Cardiff Central Train Station or alternatively, Cathays Train Station is located right next to the building and is only a 10 minute journey from Cardiff Central.</p>
