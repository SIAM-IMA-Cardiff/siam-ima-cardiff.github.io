	<h2>About </h2>
	<p>The Cardiff SIAM-IMA Student Chapter is proud to host the SIAM UKIE National Student Chapter Conference in 2024. The conference is a two-day event on Thursday 13th and Friday 14th of June. </p>
	<p>The two-day conference will include four invited talks, contributed talks by attendees, a poster session and a conference dinner. Invited speakers cover various mathematical backgrounds, and we are pleased to also have an industry speaker at the conference. The conference is open to all postgraduate research students across the UK and Ireland. There will be plenty of opportunities to network. Moreover, this offers a great chance to those attending to present their research, either through a poster or a contributed talk.</p>
	<p>The conference will be held in the newly built Abacws building, located in Cardiff. We are a 30 minute walk from Cardiff Central Train Station or alternatively, Cathays Train Station is located right next to the building and is only a 10 minute journey from Cardiff Central.</p>

	<p>We are pleased to annouce the following plenary speakers, with abstracts to follow shortly:</p>

	<h3>Speaker 1: Prof. Igor Podlubny ~ Technical University of Kosice<br> Thursday 13th June, 10:00 - 11:00</h3>
	<div class="card mb-3 border-0" style="max-width: 1000px;">

				<img src="/images/Conference Pictures/Igor-Podlubny.jpg" class="speaker-image img-fluid rounded" alt="Prof. Igor Podlubny">
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-9">
				<div class="card-body">
					<h5 class="card-title">Fractional-order calculus in one hour: ideas, methods, and tools</h5>
					<p class="card-text">Bio: Prof. Podlubny's research focuses on the theory and applications of fractional calculus. He has published over 200 papers in peer-reviewed journals and is the author of the book "Fractional Differential Equations".</p>
					<p class="card-text">Abstract: Fractional calculus is a short name denoting the generalization of differentiation and integration to non-integer orders. We will take a look at the historical development of the ideas of generalized differentiation, geometric and physical interpretations, some methods for evaluation of fractional-order derivatives, fractional-order differential equations and methods for their analytical and numerical solution, and at applications of fractional-order modeling in science and engineering. </p>

	<h3>Speaker 2: Prof. Claudia Garetto ~ Queen Mary University of London <br> Thursday 13th June, 13:30 - 14:30</h3>
	<div class="card mb-3 border-0" style="max-width: 1000px;">
		<div class="row g-0">
			<div class="col-md-9">
				<div class="card-body">
					<h5 class="card-title">C<sup>&#x221E;</sup> well-posedness of higher order hyperbolic equations with multiplicities</h5>
					<p class="card-text">Bio: Prof. Garetto's expertise lies in the field of Partial Differential Equations and Mathematical Analysis. Her research delves deeply into various aspects of this field, including hyperbolic equations and systems with multiplicities, PDEs characterized by singular coefficients and very weak solutions, and sub-elliptic problems on compact Lie groups.</p>
					<p class="card-text">Abstract: In this talk with I will present some recent results obtained in collaboration with Bolys Sabitbek (QMUL) on higher order hyperbolic equations with multiplicities. Particular focus will be given to the conditions on the lower order terms (Levi conditions) required to obtain $C^\infty$ well-posedness of the corresponding Cauchy problem. </p>

	<h3>Speaker 3: Dr. Isaac Chenchiah ~ University of Bristol<br>Friday 14th June, 09:00 - 10:00</h3>

	<div class="card mb-3 border-0" style="max-width: 1000px;">

				<img src="/images/Conference Pictures/Isaac Pic.jpg" class="speaker-image img-fluid rounded" alt="Dr. Isaac Chenchiah">
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-9">
				<div class="card-body">
					<h5 class="card-title">Morphing Triangular Frameworks</h5>
					<p class="card-text">Bio: Dr. Chenchiah expertise lies at the interface between mathematics on one hand, and solid mechanics, structural engineering & biology on the other hand. Current projects include morphing structures, wound healing and electroreception in bees.</p>
					<p class="card-text">Abstract: A morphing structure can change its shape in response to its environment. For example, a morphing aerofoil would adjust its shape to the surrounding atmospheric conditions and ﬂight regime (e.g. take-oﬀ, cruising, landing). Another example is a medical implant that could adapt as the patient grows or ages, thus reducing the need for subsequent surgical intervention. <br>				
					In this talk, we explore a class of morphing structures: planar triangular frameworks comprised of bi-stable edges. We explore their low-energy states and characterise all stable hexagonal shapes, including those with an annulus. <br>						
					This is joint work with Matthew O’Donnell at the University of the West of England.</p>

	<h3>Speaker 4: Dr. Matthew Jones ~ Nationwide Building Society<br> Friday 14th June, 11:30 - 12:30</h3>
	<div class="card mb-3 border-0" style="max-width: 1000px;">
		<div class="row g-0">
			<div class="col-md-9">
				<div class="card-body">
					<h5 class="card-title">An overview of the application Artificial Intelligence in Financial Services</h5>
					<p class="card-text">Bio: Dr. Jones's is head of Risk Decision Science and Analytical Innovation at Nationwide Building Society. He is responsible for motivating and nurturing a large advanced analytics team delivering cutting edge tools across multiple business departments to drive optimal business outcomes.</p>
					<p class="card-text">Abstract: The last decade has witnessed an explosion of interest in the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), driven by its user friendly and game changing applications.  Understandably this has stirred up a great deal of excitement and trepidation around AI, orientating around: what is it; opportunities that it can drive; risks/harms it can cause; how it can be managed and what the future holds.<br>
					Risk Decision Science & Analytical Innovation have been at the forefront of its application at Nationwide Building Society where different Machine Learning techniques have been applied to enhance Credit Scoring and augment financial crime defences – culminating in multiple financial services industry awards for the team.<br>
					In this session, the speaker will provide: an overview of AI; bring it to life via Use Cases at Nationwide; share key risks and thoughts on the future in this focal and growing area in financial services. </p>
